<Cocktails>
For a developer, it's important to quickly find some cocktail that they might not have even seen before. In this project that was assigned to our self-study group, there were four of us, and we divided the work into sections.

My part was the 'hero' section, where the rendering was implemented based on API requests using fetch. The entire functionality was written in JavaScript, and the rendering of letters was achieved through different screen width conditions
